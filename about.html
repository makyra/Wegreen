  <h2>Statistics</h2>
  <p>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Two-thirds of extreme weather events in the last 20 years were influenced by humans.</li>
    <br>
    <li>120,000 square kilometres of tropical forest were lost in 2018.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Up to 90 percent of coral reefs will disappear. Coral reefs are an important part of the sea life ecosystem. They provide food for fish species and buffer coastlines against storms and erosion. An increase as tiny as 1.5 degrees Celsius will bring near total decimation of this vital part of the ocean.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Sea levels are expected to rise 1 to 4 feet in the next 80 years due to melting ice in Antarctic regions. This will cause damaging floods and other ecological disasters that are bound to negatively affect humans as well as multiple species of animals.</li>
    <br>
    <li>A rise in temperature increases air pollution and other allergy provoking substances in our environment.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fossil fuel use is the primary source of CO2. CO2 can also be emitted from direct human-induced impacts on forestry and other land use, such as through deforestation, land clearing for agriculture, and degradation of soils. Likewise, land can also remove CO2 from the atmosphere through reforestation, improvement of soils, and other activities.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Industry is responsible for about 21% of 2010 global greenhouse gas emissions.</li>

<h5>we green was created during our time at the Girls Who Code 2019 Summer Immersion Program.
We wanted to create a site which enabled Austin teens to help the environment.
We hope our website raises awareness about environmental issues and encourages Austin teens to pick up eco-friendly habits.</h5>
