    <h1>Tip List</h1>
    <div><strong><num>1.</num> Wash laundry on cold</strong> to save energy</div>
    <div><strong><num>2.</num> Compost</strong> all soiled paper</div>
    <div><strong><num>3.</num> Put recycling bins in your bedroom.</strong>This will help make recycling even more effortless and accessible.</div>
    <div><strong><num>4.</num> Only have ceiling fan on while you are in the room.</strong> It doesn’t actually change the temperature of the room, just makes people in the room more comfortable.</div>
    <div><strong><num>5.</num> Whenever possible line dry</strong> instead of using a dryer. </div>
    <div><strong><num>6.</num> Switch from incandescent</strong> to LED bulbs to save energy.</div>
    <div><strong><num>7.</num> Keep tires properly inflated</strong> to increase fuel mileage</div>
    <div><strong><num>8.</num> Remove excess weight from your car</strong> to increase fuel mileage</div>
    <div><strong><num>9.</num> Avoid air travel whenever possible,</strong> and when you do fly, make it economy. Since an economy traveler takes up less space on a plane, you are causing less emissions.</div>
    <div><strong><num>10.</num> Turn off bulbs</strong> when you leave a room</div>
    <div><strong><num>11.</num> Try to limit consumption of animal products.</strong> Animal products create large amounts of waste and emissions.</div>
    <div><strong><num>12.</num> Try to reduce shower time</strong> to no more than 10 minutes a day</div>
    <div><strong><num>13.</num> Buy in bulk</strong> when possible, and use reusable packaging. For example, reuse plastic containers and bags or use glass jars.</div>
    <div><strong><num>14.</num> Reuse produce bags</strong> at the grocery store, and only get new bags when necessary. </div>
    <div><strong><num>15.</num> Bring reusable bags</strong> to the grocery store. Store them in your car so you don’t forget!</div>
    <div><strong><num>16.</num> When buying packaged goods, try to make sure the packaging is recyclable.</strong> This will greatly lessen the amount of trash you create.</div>
    <div><strong><num>17.</num> Put extra effort into recycling.</strong> For instance, wash out yogurt containers and recycle instead of just trashing them.</div>
    <div><strong><num>18.</num> Try to buy local,</strong> as buying local not only supports the community but also helps cut down on emissions produced in transportation.</div>
    <div><strong><num>19.</num> Try to buy used products</strong>(like thrift shopping) when possible, as used products cut down on the “provision of goods”, which refers to all the resources which are used to produce new goods</div>
    <div><strong><num>20.</num> Better insulate your home</strong> in order to use less energy on heating and coodivng.</div>
    <div><strong><num>21.</num> Use air conditioning and heating as sparingly as possible.</strong> While the use of A/C and heating is unavoidable, keeping your house a few degrees warmer in the summer and a few degrees cooler in the winter can save a great amount of energy or fuel.</div>
    <div><strong><num>22.</num> Buy organic</strong> when possible, as many pesticides are produced using fossil fuels. </div>
    <div id ="jump"><strong><num>23.</num> Turn down the hot water</strong> in the shower. While it is not realistic for everyone to take cold showers, taking a lukewarm shower instead of a steaming hot one can save a lot of energy.</div>
    <div><strong><num>24.</num> Try to use reusable containers </strong>instead of sandwich or Ziploc bags.</div>
    <div><strong><num>25.</num> Do research into the <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/single-stream-recycling">Austin recycling system</a></strong> to get to know what you can and can’t recycle, and make sure you are always recycling when possible!</div>
    <div><strong><num>26.</num> Do research into the <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/austincomposts"> Austin composting system </a></strong> to get to know what you can and can’t compost, and make sure you are always composting when possible! </div>
    <div><strong><num>27.</num> Shop more sparingly</strong> at the grocery store to try to reduce food waste. Only buy food you know you will eat.</div>
    <div><strong><num>28.</num> Try to repair old or broken products</strong>instead of buying new ones. </div>
    <div><strong><num>29.</num> Avoid disposable</strong> utensils, plates, and the like whenever possible.</div>
    <div><strong><num>30.</num> Use reusable water bottles </strong>whenever possible.</div>
    <div><strong><num>31.</num> Bring your own utensils</strong> to restaurants in case they have only plastic cutlery.</div>
    <div><strong><num>32.</num> Use cloth napkins </strong>in lieu of paper ones.</div>
    <div><strong><num>33.</num> Use rags instead of paper towels</strong> for cleaning.</div>
    <div><strong><num>34.</num> Reuse or avoid using trash bags in trash cans</strong> when possible.</div>
